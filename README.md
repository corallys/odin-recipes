In this lesson I learned how to open another repos on Git Hub
and also learned how to perfect my commit messages. Using my local
machine, which is terminal. I will learn how to move my new repos onto it into the repos folder. THen I learn how to create git commit messages using git commit -m "enter commit text here".
